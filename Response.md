Dear Prof. Stinebring,

Thanks for the patient review and kind suggestions. The following statements are our responses to your suggestions.

* We moved the section "VLBI Astrometry" one section up to Section 2. And corresponding references to the sections are modified: 
1. The last paragraph of Section 1 
2. The first sentence in this section has been changed into:  "In order to eliminate the degeneracies inherent in lens modelling, we undertook an astrometric VLBI program to measure the distance and transverse velocity of PSR B0834+06."

* "Why is the 1-ms feature simply not single scattering due to a 2nd screen?"
The answer to this question is being discussed in Section 3.2.3, which is mainly based on the answers that you provide.

1. We added the answer to possibility of adding multi-screen simulation and why we did not do that by the end of Section 3.3.3
2. While it is hard to assess the dual-refraction explanation for the 1 ms feature, we list our best attempt in Figure 12, and will be happy to see further observation data and feedback on this. Furthermore, we modified in Section 1 Introduction, from "The precise model confirms the one dimensional nature of the scattering geometry" to "The precise model fits the one dimensional nature of the scattering geometry"

* For the majority parts of the usage "single-lens" and "double-lens", we changed them to "single-refraction" and "double-refraction". While thinking about whether the word "lens" is could be considered an appropriate word to express the meaning of "refract", we checked the Oxford dictionary and Merriam-Webster dictionary, and the verb meaning is not mentioned in the dictionary. However, when consider the usage of "micro-lensing", "strong-lensing" in Astronomy, we continue using this method. Furthermore, we made a better illustration in figure 7 to show the singly-refracted and doubly-refracted images.


* More notes on the paper. 
1. The typos and the syntax errors are modified according to your requirements. 

2. The fonts of the figures (Figure 4, 5, 8, 9,10,11,12 ) are modified to make them more readable.

3. In Abstract, we changed the first sentence into: We test the inclined sheet pulsar scintillation model (Pen & King 2014) against archival VLBI data on PSR 0834+06 and show that its scintillation properties can be precisely reproduced by a model in which refraction occurs on two distinct lens planes.”

4. In the second sentence in the Abstract, the meaning of the “the grazing sheet model” will be obscure to many readers.  We changed the expression into "These data strongly favour a model in which grazing-incidence refraction instead of diffraction off turbulent structures is the primary source of pulsar scattering."

5. In Section 1, these two sentences should be reversed: ". In B10, VLBI astrometric mapping directly demonstrated the highly collinear nature of a single dominant lensing structure. First hints of single plane collinear dominated structure had been realized in Stinebring et al.(2001)." (It makes more sense to introduce them in time order)

6. The title for Figure 4 is changed from 314.5 MHz to 330.5 MHz. The aim of Figure 4 here is just to display the points in 1 ms group and 0.4 ms group, as well as those with positive differential frequency.  We want to display them with all the observation data in a specific band, which in this case is band with reference frequency of 330.5MHz. For the caption of Figure 4, we state that this is showing a schematic of a secondary spectrum. The other tables are marked obviously with our scaled reference frequency (322.5MHz). We added equation 1 to explain in detail.

7. We added more explanation for Eq.2 and 3( how we calculated the standard deviation of f_D, \tau, \delta_ra, \delta_dec for each apex).

8. The differential frequency of point 5 listed in Table 1 is modified from -21.6(6)mHz to -21.2(6) mHz, due to an error in our previous calculation.

9. In Section 3.2.1, the definition of parallel and perpendicular is modified to what you suggested.

10. In Section 3.2.1, When express the process of calculating the distance to the single lens, we write in the following method "The distance of lens 1, where the group of scintillation points with $0.4$-ms delays are refracted, is $D_1 = 389$ pc, as we take $D_{1{\rm e}}=1044$ pc."

11. In Section 3.3, the saying "the number of sheets at shallower inclination increases as the square of this small angle." is what we want to express. The inclination angle we mention here, is the mean value of \alpha_i (refer to Figure 3), in Pen and Levin (2014) Figure 1, is the angle between the line of sight and the sheet. In analogy, it is similar to reflection of lights on surface waves(Figure 1). The lower the lights on the shore (shallower inclination angle), the longer the sheets on the water surface. More analytically, it is explained in the second paragraph after equation 4 in Pen and Levin (2014).

12. In section 4.1, these data rule out retrograde or radially Galactic orbits, and indicate that the lens is co-rotating with the Galaxy.

13. In conclusion, the first sentence is modified from "planar-parallel" to "planar", according to the second meaning you pointed out.
